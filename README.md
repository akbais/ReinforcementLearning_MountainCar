**ReinforcementLearning_MountainCar**
Reinforcement Learning Algorithm to mimic a mountain car using SARSA
SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) is an on-policy temporal difference
reinforcement learning algorithm. It is used to learn an optimal policy for an agent 
interacting with an environment, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
